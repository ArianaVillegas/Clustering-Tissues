# Clustering of Similar Tissues in Genetic Information Database

This project aims to apply clustering techniques to find similar tissues in a genetic information database. The database contains two files: 

- `datasettissue.txt`: This file contains 22215 rows and 189 columns, where each column represents numerical information of a tissue type. Therefore, there are 189 tissues, each with a dimension of 22215. The first row of the file stores the names of each column, and the first column stores the name of each row. 
- `clases.txt`: This file provides the names of each tissue.

## Usage

To run the experiments located in the `main.py` file, run the following command:

```
‚ùØ python3 main.py
```
